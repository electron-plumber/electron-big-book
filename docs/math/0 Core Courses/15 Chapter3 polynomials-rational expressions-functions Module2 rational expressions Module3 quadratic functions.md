# Module 3-02 Rational Expressions and Operations

## 1.Concept of Rational Expressions
- Definition: let $A$ and $B$ be __two polynomials__.
  The division $\boldsymbol{A \div B}$ can be written in __the form $\boldsymbol{\frac{A}{B}}$__.
  If __the divisor $\boldsymbol{B}$ contains a variable__, then __the expression $\boldsymbol{\frac{A}{B}}$ is called a rational expression__.
- $\boldsymbol{\frac{2}{3x+1}}$ can be __called a rational expression__.


## 2.Properties of Rational Expressions

### $\textcolor{#1E3A5F}{\fbox{1}}\:$Description
- If both the numerator and denominator of a rational expression are __multiplied or divided by the same nonzero polynomial__,
  the value of the rational expression __remains unchanged__.
- $\boldsymbol{\frac{A}{B}=\frac{AM}{BM}, \frac{A}{B}=\frac{A \div M}{B \div M}}$ ($M\ne0$ and $M$ is a polynomial)

### $\textcolor{#1E3A5F}{\fbox{2}}\:$Applications
- Sign rule: for the signs of __the numerator__, __denominator__, and __the rational expression__ itself,
  __changing any two of them does not change the value of the expression__.
  - $\boldsymbol{\frac{-a}{-b}=\frac{a}{b}, \frac{-a}{b}=\frac{a}{-b}=-\frac{a}{b}}$
- Reduction (cancellation): removing __all common factors__ of __the numerator and denominator__ of a rational expression is __called reduction__.
- Common denominator: converting several __rational expressions with different denominators__ into __equivalent expressions with the same denominator__ is __called finding a common denominator__.

  
## 3.Operations with Rational Expressions

### $\textcolor{#1E3A5F}{\fbox{1}}\:$Addition and subtraction rules
- Same denominator: when adding or subtracting rational expressions with the same denominator,
  __add or subtract the numerators__ while __keeping the denominator unchanged__.
  - $\boldsymbol{\frac{a}{c}\pm \frac{b}{c}=\frac{a \pm b}{c}}$
- Different denominators: when the denominators are different,
  __first find a common denominator__,
  then __perform addition or subtraction__.

### $\textcolor{#1E3A5F}{\fbox{2}}\:$Multiplication rule
- To multiply rational expressions,
  multiply __the numerators together for the new numerator__,
  and multiply __the denominators together for the new denominator__.
- $\boldsymbol{\frac{a}{b}\cdot\frac{c}{d}=\frac{ac}{bd}}$

### $\textcolor{#1E3A5F}{\fbox{3}}\:$Division rule
- To divide rational expressions, multiply __the dividend by the reciprocal of the divisor__.
- $\boldsymbol{\frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d}=\frac{a}{b}\cdot\frac{d}{c}=\frac{ad}{bc}}$

### $\textcolor{#1E3A5F}{\fbox{4}}\:$Exponentiation rule
- To raise a rational expression to a power,
  raise __both the numerator and denominator to that power__.
- $\boldsymbol{(\frac{a}{b})^n=\frac{a^n}{b^n}}$

### $\textcolor{#1E3A5F}{\fbox{5}}\:$Complex fractions
- Can be simplified using __the division rule__.
- Can also be simplified using __the fundamental property of rational expressions__.


## 4.Simplest Form of a Rational Expression
- A rational expression is in simplest form when __its numerator and denominator have no common factors__.
  The final form of a rational expression must be __its simplest form__,
  and simplifying a rational expression usually involves __canceling common factors (reduction)__.
